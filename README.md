Execom Android workshops qualification task

Your task for this year's Android workshops will be a simple to-do list
application. When the user enters the application, he/she should be presented with
a list of all his/her tasks (thus, the tasks should be saved somehow). He/she also
needs a way of adding a new task, preferably in a new screen (activity) or in a
pop-up dialog. To simplify things, the task must just have a title, which is displayed
in the previously mentioned list.

For the daring and adventurous, we have a bonus feature that grants extra
credit. Upon clicking one task in the list, the application goes to a new activity with
the task details, where the user is shown the task title and task description (note
that you will need to enter that description when adding the task then). There the
user needs to have two options. To mark the task as done and to remove the task
from the application. Tasks that are marked done should be displayed differently in
the mentioned list.
